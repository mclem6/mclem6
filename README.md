Hi, I’m Maria.

I am a senior at the University of Illinois in Chicago (UIC), pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. This semester, I am enrolled in Introduction to Machine Learning, Computer Algorithms, and Software Development of Mobile Applications, which are electives I chose and am excited to dive into as I continue to explore the vast field of computer science.

I decided to pursue a degree in computer science because technology is super cool! I am consistently inspired by how it is leveraged to increase accessibility, improve quality of service, and connect people. My dream is to build a career working with companies that develop and maintain digital products that empower individuals to lead better and healthier lives. 

Currently I am working on mastering Java and becoming a Java full-stack developer. I enjoy learning about designing and developing user-friendly interfaces and best practices in writing maintainable and scalable back-end code. I am also intrigued by managing and processing data, especially data that provide meaningful insights and can lead to impactful solutions. 

Things I am working on:
- Diving deeper into Pandas and Numphy to create learning models such as the ID3 decision tree using Python.
- Learning how to use Android Studio and I can't wait to develop my first mobile application.
- Becoming Network+ certified
- Building a full-stack application in Java
  
Languages
- Java, Python, C++, C, DAX

Other
- Pandas, JavaFX, 
- PowerBI, Linux OS, embedded systems (Arduino Uno)
  


I am always open to collaborating and networking, don't hesitate to connect me on LinkedIn!
