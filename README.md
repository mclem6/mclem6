Hi, I’m Maria!

I am a senior at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. This semester, I am enrolled in Introduction to Machine Learning, Computer Algorithms, and Development of Mobile Applications, which are electives I chose and am excited to dive into as I continue to explore the vast field of computer science.

I decided to pursue a degree in computer science because technology is super cool! I am consistently inspired by how it is leveraged to increase accessibility, improve the quality of service, and connect people all over the world. My dream is to build a career working with companies that develop and maintain digital products that empower individuals to lead better and healthier lives. 

I'm currently diving deep into Java to build both desktop and Android applications. I’m especially passionate about crafting intuitive user interfaces and writing clean, scalable back-end code. 

Things I am working on:
- Developing a productivity/organization software to help students manage their coursework. 
- Tinkering with Pandas and NumPy to create machine learning models using algorithms like the ID3 decision tree and CNN.
- Learning how to use Android Studio and developing Android applications.
- Becoming Network+ certified
  
Languages
- Java, Python, C++, C, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, DAX

Tools
- Pandas, JavaFX, CalendarFx, SQLite, PowerBI

Others
- Linux OS, Android OS, embedded systems (Arduino Uno)
  


I am always open to collaborating and networking, don't hesitate to contact me on LinkedIn!
