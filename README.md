ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maria Clement and I am a senior computer science student at UIC. 

//past
I decided to pursue this degree after stumbling upon the CS50 Harvard course on YouTube. I fell in love with this new way of thinking, of breaking down big problems into small, more manageable, less overwhelming parts, and through this process, finding a solution for the whole. Since then, I have applied this to all areas of my life and have seen its transformative powers. 

//present
I am currently a senior at UIC taking Intro to Machine Learning, Computer Algorithms, and Software Development of Mobile Applications. I am enjoying learning about different learning models, their implementation, and their uses cases. I just built my first model using ID3 algorithm using Python! I am also learning about Android and can't wait to code my first mobile application this semester. 

//Future
Things I am working on:
- Studying for my CompTIA A+ recertification
- Making Plans to get Network+ certificate.
