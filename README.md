ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maria Clement.

I am a senior at UIC and am taking Intro to Machine Learning, Computer Algorithms, and Software Development of Mobile Applications this semester

I decided to pursue a degree in computer science after stumbling upon the first CS50 Harvard lecture on YouTube. I fell in love with this new way of thinking, of breaking down big problems into small, manageable, essential parts (ie decomposition) and, through this process, finding a solution for the whole. Since then, I have applied this method to all areas of my life and have seen its transformative powers!

Things I am working on:
- I just built my first learning model implementing the ID3 algorithm using Python! 
- I am finding my way around Android Studio and can't wait to develop my first mobile application this semester. 
- Becoming Network+ certified
- Building a full-stack application in Java
  
Skills
- Java, JavaFX,
- Python, Pandas
- C++, C
- embedded systems (Arduino Uno)
- Linux OS
