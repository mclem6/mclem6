ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maria Clement and I am a senior computer science student at UIC. 

//past
I decided to pursue a degree in computer science after stumbling upon the first CS50 Harvard lecture on YouTube. I fell in love with this new way of thinking, of breaking down big problems into small, manageable, essential parts and, through this process, finding a solution for the whole. Since then, I have applied this method to all areas of my life and have seen its transformative powers!

I am a senior at UIC currently taking Intro to Machine Learning, Computer Algorithms, and Software Development of Mobile Applications. I just built my first model implementing the ID3 algorithm using Python! I am finding my way around Android Studio, and I can't wait to develop my first mobile application this semester. 

Things I am working on:
- Studying for my CompTIA A+ recertification
- Making Plans to be Network+ certified
- Building a full-stack application in Java
- Redesigning and adding animations to my [portfolio website](https://mclem6.github.io/)
