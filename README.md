Hi, I’m Maria.

I am currently a senior at the University of Illinois in Chicago (UIC) where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. This semester, I am enrolled in Introduction to Machine Learning, Computer Algorithms, and Software Development of Mobile Applications which are electives I chose and excited to dive into as I continue to explore the vast field of computer science.

I decided to pursue a degree in computer science because technology is the backbone of accessibility, and I want to be a part of leveraging it to remove barriers that impact the quality of life. My goal is to build a career working with companies that are dedicated to
developing and maintaining digital products that provide value for under-represented groups.

I am particularly interested in learning and becoming a full-stack developer in Java. I enjoy learning about the design and development of user-friendly interfaces as well as best practices in writing maintainable and scalable back-end code. I am also intrigued by managing and processing big data especially data that provide meaningful insights and lead to transformative solutions. 

Things I am working on:
- I just built my first learning model implementing the ID3 algorithm using Python.
- I am finding my way around Android Studio and can't wait to develop my first mobile application.
- Becoming Network+ certified
- Building a full-stack application in Java
  
Skills
- Java, JavaFX,
- Python, Pandas
- C++, C
- embedded systems (Arduino Uno)
- Linux OS
- PowerBI, DAX


I am always open to collaborating and networking, don't hesitate to connect me on LinkedIn!
